> An easy way to manage your modpacks, written in Dart and Flutter.
> Formerly Minecraft Modpack Manager Reborn

</div>

### Working features

- #### Applying modpacks

- #### Clearing modpacks

- #### Reloading modpacks in the list

- #### Opening modpacks folder

- #### Installing mods and resourcepacks (not modpacks) from curseforge/modrinth

- #### Installing shaders from modrinth and (partially) curseforge

- #### Importing and exporting modpacks

- ### Updating mods from curseforge and modrinth

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Why can't I include modpacks from curseforge? Although I do have API access to curseforge modpack API, I cannot completely install everything from a modpack, since many modpacks tend to overwrite some of minecraft's settings and/or install external resource packs. I do not wish to deal with that.
